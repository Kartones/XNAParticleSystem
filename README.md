XNA 1.0 Particle System
=======================

Basic 3D particle engine, built on the first version of Microsoft XNA, by me and a friend.

Uses the XNA content pipeline and input components, and basically renders particles using 2D textures and implementing
a few different emmiters.

You can check a brief slidedeck about it at [https://slides.kartones.net/013.html](https://slides.kartones.net/013.html)

Notes
-----
* It was built long time ago using XNA 1.0 and .NET 2.0, so will probably require fixing compile errors due to newer
versions of XNA and changes in its components.
